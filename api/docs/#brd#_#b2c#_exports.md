## Basic Flow

1. An overseas buyer logs in to one of ONDC’s buyer apps
2. The overseas buyer searches for a product to be purchased from India on Buyer App
3. Gateway broadcasts the buyer app’s“search” packet to relevant seller apps that qualify for “B2C export to the destination country” per serviceability construct
4. In response to the buyer app’s “search” packet, Seller Apps (in India) share item(s)’ price(s), catalog(s) (matching the search query) with the buyer app via “on_search” packet(s)
5. The buyer app displays product’s information on its Category Landing Page (CLP) and Product Display Page (PDP) respectively. Price is displayed in any one of the globally accepted currencies defined by Buyer app
6. The overseas buyer selects the product they want to purchase
7. Seller apps (in India) share the Order Value and other relevant details, with the buyer app
8. Buyer enters the shipping / delivery address (with location and pincode) on the buyer app
9. Once the buyer provides the shipping address (of destination country)\*, the buyer app requests the seller app to send details such as payment link and T&C
10. The seller app shares payment details & terms, invoice, payment value, & terms
11. Buyer app displays the payment details of either the seller on record
12. Buyer makes the payment in foreign currency

### Serviceability Check

- Buyer App allows the buyer to choose an international address as shipping/ delivery address
- Seller Apps should return search results from those sellers only who are eligible to export product(s) to that international address
- While placing the order, the buyer’s current location might be different from the international address chosen for shipping/delivery, and hence, the serviceability check applies on the shipping/ delivery address and not on the buyer’s current location, unless they are the same
