summary: Retail 1.2.5 (Commercial Model for BNP/SNP)
description: The Buyer NP (BNP) selects specific options for each item, including the convenience fee applied as a channel margin. The np_fees options are provided by the Seller NP (SNP) in the /on_select response, where they are included in the quote.breakup with a quote line item labeled title_type="misc". The BNP then selects the desired fee option for each item, which is sent as part of the /init request. In response, the SNP provides an updated quote, including the selected options, in the /on_init response. This ensures that both parties have aligned pricing details, reflecting any additional charges based on the selected fee options.
